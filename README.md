#Project Description

Barack Obama is left-handed. So are Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey; so were Babe Ruth and Marie Curie. A 1991 study reported that left-handed people die on average nine years earlier than right-handed people. Nine years! Could this really be true?

In this project, you will explore this phenomenon using age distribution data to see if we can reproduce a difference in average age at death purely from the changing rates of left-handedness over time, refuting the claim of early death for left-handers. This notebook uses pandas and Bayesian statistics to analyze the probability of being a certain age at death given that you are reported as left-handed or right-handed.

#Project Tasks
1. Where are the old left-handed people?
2. Rates of left-handedness over time
3. Applying Bayes' rule
4. When do people normally die?
5. The overall probability of left-handedness
6. Putting it all together: dying while left-handed (i)
7. Putting it all together: dying while left-handed (ii)
8. Plotting the distributions of conditional probabilities
9. Moment of truth: age of left and right-handers at death
